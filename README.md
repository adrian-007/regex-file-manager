# Regex File Manager
Very simple, yet useful tool for doing batch operations on set of files.

Files are matched against a regular expression pattern (.* by default). In case of rename operation, new name is constructed basing on provided format ($& by default).
In order to rename / delete files, you must first perform a search.
